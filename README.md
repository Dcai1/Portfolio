# Why I Built This?

**It was the ultimate test of skill.**

I felt like as a web developer, I could really leave a good impression by showcasing all my projects and skills on a website I built from the ground up, all alone. Creating this portfolio was not just writing code, but involved planning the structure, designing graphical elements aligning with website colors using external tools, designing a clean and responsive layout, and ensuring smooth responsiveness across all types of devices.

Along the way, I applied technical skills such as React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and soft skills like problem-solving, adaptability, and attention to detail.

This was a fun and valuable journey that also challenged me to think and act like both a developer and a designer.
Even now, I’m always looking for ways to expand this project with new pages, features, or details as I continue to grow my skill set.
